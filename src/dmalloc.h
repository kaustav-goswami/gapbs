// This file is taken from simple-graph to allocate memory for the graph
// software. It understands master and worker to make sure that the clients are
// not allowed to modify the graph in the remote host.

// The master node should ONLY be responsible for allocating the graph.

// For testing on a local host, the code can switch to use a hugepage. Huge
// pages must be enabled to do so.

// We need a overlord function that manages all the different objects for
// allocations. pvector is called multiple times, which makes managing a flat
// range of memory difficult.
